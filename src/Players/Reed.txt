*** PART III (10 pt) ***

Is it a good idea to start the game with the Reed opening?

The easiest way to check whether the Reed opening is good is to check two evaluations:

* The first thing we can check is the static evaluation of our utility. We can check the value of the utility function
for the player X after playing the Reed opening. Let us call this a static evaluation.

* However, there is also a better way. We can look ahead and check Minimax value for this position. Let us call this
a dynamic evaluation. 

Using my extension module "Evaluator" for boardSize = 9, and the game input "c3h,e8,f3h,e7" I got the following evaluations:
* static= -2
* dynamic= -2

This means that the player Y is 2 "points" ahead of the Reed player after the opening. So, this opening is not very good.

Analyzing the evaluation, it might be better to go for the standard opening (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoridor)
and begin with e2, e3. If the other player plays:
* in a good way "e2,e8,e3,e7" the evaluations are static=0, dynamic=0 (drawish)
* in a bad way "e2,d9,e3,c9" the evaluations are static=2, dynamic=2 (winning for the Player X)

Another way is to arrange a game between Minimax which starts with the Reed opening vs the normal Minimax. If the first Minimax that
starts with the Reed opening loses, this will mean that the Reed opening is not good.

The file Players/Reed.hs implements a player who always starts with the Reed opening and after doing it continues with Minimax.

I have created a battle between the first Minimax that uses the Reed opening vs the normal Minimax. The final position of this
game is shown in 'reed.png'.The player X lost, proving that the Reed opening is bad.
Overall, this opening is a bad one. If the other player starts rushing ahead towards the winning row, the Reed opening
might be losing.
